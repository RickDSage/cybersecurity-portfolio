# 🛡️ Derek Charles Agyei – Cybersecurity Portfolio

## 👋 About Me
I’m Derek, a Computing & Cybersecurity student based in London.  
Future SOC Analyst 🚀 | Passionate about tech, anime, and chasing big goals.  
One day I’ll be the **Hokage** or the **Pirate King** — until then, I’m breaking down threats, building defensive labs, and sharpening my craft.

## 📂 Labs & Write-Ups

### 🔹 [Nmap Scan Lab](./nmap-scan/README.md)
Hands-on with Nmap & Zenmap.  
I scanned localhost using different modes to identify:
- Open ports (attack surface)  
- OS & service detection (recon)  
- Vulnerability scans (like SMB & WannaCry checks)  
- Zenmap topology maps  

👉 Shows how attackers see a system, and how defenders should respond.

### 🔹 Upcoming Labs
- **Wireshark Lab** → Packet sniffing & suspicious traffic analysis  
- **Splunk Lab** → Log correlation, SIEM alerts, and detection use-cases  
- **Python Security Scripts** → Automating brute-force detection & log parsing  
- **Incident Response Playbooks** → Practical response workflows

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong defensive security portfolio 💻  
- Land my first SOC / Cybersecurity Analyst role 🛡️  
- Keep learning, keep shipping labs, and document every step.
